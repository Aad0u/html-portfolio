<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a security-focused and mission-driven professional with leadership experience as a Staff Sergeant in the Estonian Defence Forces. I’ve completed Cyber Command, Signal School – Senior NCO Signal Course, hold a Level 4 Security Officer certificate (2025), and have completed specialized airport security training — all part of a diverse set of skills and experience I've built through my military and security career.</p>

<p>In my military role, I led and trained units of over 40 personnel, managed mission-critical communications and equipment, and ensured operational effectiveness under pressure. These experiences shaped my strong sense of discipline, accountability, and tactical thinking.</p>

<p>I'm also highly motivated to grow in IT. While I don't yet have formal education in IT, I’m actively learning — especially in areas like html, javascript, css, python, computer hardware, systems, and digital tools.
I'm currently looking for opportunities in security or IT.</p>
